OS Security Event Logger
Overview
OS Security Event Logger is a real-time system monitoring tool designed to track system events, resource usage, and security alerts. Its purpose is to continuously oversee various aspects of your operating system, ensuring that any potential security issues or performance bottlenecks are detected immediately. This tool is ideal for system administrators, security professionals, and developers who need to maintain robust oversight of system integrity and resource efficiency.

Key Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously observe system events and performance metrics as they occur.

Event Logging: Capture detailed logs for a wide variety of system events, including system startups, shutdowns, user logins, and more.

Resource Usage Tracking: Monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network activity to detect abnormal usage patterns.

Security Alerts: Detect and immediately report potential security issues such as unauthorized access attempts, file integrity changes, and other suspicious activities.

Customizable Rules: Configure thresholds and rules for what constitutes an alert, enabling tailored monitoring to suit different environments.

Integration Capabilities: Easily integrate with other monitoring tools or centralized logging platforms (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk).

Historical Data Analysis: Store logs and usage data for auditing purposes and post-event analysis.

Architecture and Design
Components
Event Collector:
The module responsible for interfacing with the operating system to capture events as they occur. This component aggregates data from various sources including system logs, application logs, and direct OS hooks.

Metrics Analyzer:
This module processes raw data to compute resource usage statistics, such as real-time CPU and memory consumption, helping to identify performance issues early.

Alert Manager:
Based on predefined rules and thresholds, the alert manager triggers notifications when a security or performance anomaly is detected. Alerts can be delivered via email, SMS, or integrated into other alerting systems.

Data Storage:
The system logs and metrics are stored in a centralized database, allowing for historical analysis and auditing. The storage system is designed to efficiently handle large volumes of data with minimal impact on system performance.

User Interface:
A dashboard interface provides real-time visualization of events, resource metrics, and alerts. Users can interact with the dashboard to view detailed logs, adjust alert settings, and perform system health diagnostics.

Workflow
Data Acquisition: The system continuously collects logs and metrics from the OS and running applications.

Data Processing: Collected data is parsed, normalized, and analyzed against predefined rules.

Alerting: If any anomalies are detected—whether in system resource usage or security-related events—alerts are immediately generated.

Reporting: Detailed logs and reports are made available through the UI for administrators to review historical data or perform forensic analysis.
